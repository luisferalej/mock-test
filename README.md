# mock-test
Testing mock library

This repository is meant for giving an insight on how to use the mock-json-response library in order to mock endpoints and responses.

Each endpoint for which a mock is needed should be added in its own file in the /functions directory.
The /data directory is supposed to have all the fake responses at which the mocked endpoinds will point to.

In order to execute this test repo:

1- npm i

2- npm start
